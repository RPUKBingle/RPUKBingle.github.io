Everything has to come to an end and unfortunately Bingle's time has come,
this is a decision that wasn't taken lightly but it was needed,
we hope everyone can remember the memory's we have made as Bingle
for the rest of your life's, it was fun while it lasted and we should all be happy
for what we achieved.

## Will bingle ever come back?

## Short answer is:
# NO
